Install the solution from the releases section and call the menu with the Alt+Z key combination.

You can easily add, delete, move groups and elements directly in the menu window. Adding new elements (shortcuts) is done from the context menu of the files themselves.

Latest version: [1.0.0 (pre-release)](https://github.com/metrome-nu/metrome.nu/releases/download/1.0.0/metrome.nu.setup.exe)
